## SYNOPSIS

`generate-patch-tutorial.py` [options] patches...

## DESCRIPTION

Generates a tutorial html document from a patch series as generated by git with
the comments in markdown format.

## OPTIONS

 * `-o output_filename`:
   Output the html to a file (given by output_filename) rather than STDOUT
 * `--suppress-decoration`:
   Usually the output file will be prepended with html, head, style, etc. tags.
   Use this option to suppress this.  This would be typically useful if you wish
   to embed the tutorial in some other page or apply your own custom styling.

## NOTES

### Markdown format

Markdown is an easy to read and write plain text markup language.  See 
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/> for more information.

generate-patch-tutorial defines some extensions to the markdown format to allow
inclusion of code and changes in the output html:

@show filename
@diff [options] filename

### Manipulating your patch series (tutorial) with git

To generate a git repository from the patch series:

    $ git init
    $ cat directory_with_patches/* | git am

To regenerate the patch series from the last 3 commits in the git repository:

    $ git format-patch -3 -o directory_with_patches/
