A tutorial pinched from Guido van Rossum's blog[1].  I chose this as it was a
nice simple and readable example of the tutorial as a series of patches.  I
asked Guido for permission to copy it to which he replied

    "I promise won't come after you for using that one little blog post. :-)"

and that's good enough for me.

A Makefile is included to illustrate how to do common tasks like:
 - `make tutorial.html` - Create a tutorial from the patches
 - `make repo` - Create a git repository from the patches
 - `make patches` - Recreate patches from the git repository
 - `make check` - Check that all the patches are valid and create a valid
   main.py
